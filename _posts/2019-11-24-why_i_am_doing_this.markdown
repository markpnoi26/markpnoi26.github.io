I used to tell people all the time that you don't need a bachelor's degree to do anything worth while in the world. I would say, if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't have gone to college to learn it is what I am doing now or I would have studied something else completely. 

Though, I believed one thing, it was a different story all together when I started to create a career in chemistry.

To give a little background, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, which I was planning on using to go to medical school. I applied myself to studying the MCAT, solidifying my understanding of the medical field and even  managed to get interviews to some odd medical schools I don't even remember anymore. However, I woke up to the reality that I was not as into it as I initially believed, maybe my parents wanting me to have big dreams had something to do with it. I'm not sure, but I don't blame them for pushing me and encouraging me in this path, afterall, they only wanted the best for me. I spent 4 years of my life trying to achieve a dream I thought I wanted, and when I was at the doorstep of realizing that dream, I walked away from all of it. 

After having that conversation with my parents about what I really wanted to pursue. I decided to use my degree to find a suitable career for myself. For the last 4 years I was able to climb through the ranks in the field of chemistry, from doing dishwashing lab glassware to managing a quality control laboratory in charge of many projects and training newer chemists, I was able to push my own limits and achieve what many would call success. I was promoted several times within the past 4 years and am now holding a senior position at my current company. 

So why am I saying all these? Well, it all goes back to what I believed vs. what I do. I wanted live out my life knowing that how I lived was going to be the same or better than how I talked about it. I used to talk about how people don't need advanced degrees to make it in the world, but my career and my life would not line up to that standard that I unconsciously set for everyone else. I don't want to live like that anymore. I want to take all my excuses and throw them out the window. I want to pursue things that matter to me and I want to live a fruitful life.

At the end of the day, I want my life to be a beacon of hope for many people. I want to be able to relate and have empathy. This is why I chose this path. My ultimate reason is to encourage those who are willing and able. Afterall, if I can do it, anyone can.
