I wanted to create a simple app that anyone can use and is intuitive enough that its really easy to navigate through. CreatiVault is an application where users can upload a photo of their creation and share it with everyone. 

The application requires a few gems/applications in order to work properly dotenv, active-storage, and imagemagick.

The common features of I took advantage of was the many to many relationships used in the simplest part of the application, the love and the flag button. While those may be simple in theory, it was actually the most difficult to achieve, because there needed to be a way for the models to separate their own creations from the flagged and loved creations.

Once the naming convention was fixed, everything else worked out. The video below shows a common flow of the whole application.
